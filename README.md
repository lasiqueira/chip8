# chip8
Chip 8 emulator written in go

## Goal
The goal of this project is to learn Golang and emulator development at the same time.
For that reason I decided to go (no pun intended) with chip8 as it's the easiest to start.

## Installation
`go build`
## Running
You can find roms scattered on the internet with ch8 extension. You can find things such as pong, space invaders, tetris and more!

`./chip8 {rom}`
